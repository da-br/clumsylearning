# Starting a blog

First time using github actions

Using Jekyll I had some issues building on github actions

Can't get Jekyll HTML-Checker to work 
The stupid html checker tool outputs to term and when I output to a file it only shows the first part

Removing baseUrl and setting it to '/' got the html checker to work

This was the first ever github action build I got to work.


Theme is not working and the url is xxx.github.io/clumsylearning. It does work locally
